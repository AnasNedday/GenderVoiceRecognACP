# GenderVoiceRecognACP

## Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that is used to reduce the dimensionality. It uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. It is often used as a dimensionality reduction technique.

### Steps Involved in the PCA : 

##### Step 1: Standardize the dataset.

#####  Step 2: Calculate the covariance matrix for the features in the dataset.

#### Step 3: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the covariance matrix.

##### Step 4: Sort eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors.

##### Step 5: Pick k eigenvalues and form a matrix of eigenvectors.

##### Step 6: Transform the original matrix.

## Gender recognition through voice and speech analysis:

This database was created to identify a male or female voice, based on the acoustic properties of voice and speech.
The dataset includes 3,168 recorded voice samples collected from male and female speakers.
Our data set starts with 20 variables.
