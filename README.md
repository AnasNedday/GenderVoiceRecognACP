##Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that is used to reduce the dimensionality. It uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. It is often used as a dimensionality reduction technique.

###Steps Involved in the PCA : 

#####Step 1: Standardize the dataset.

#####Step 2: Calculate the covariance matrix for the features in the dataset.

#####Step 3: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the covariance matrix.

#####Step 4: Sort eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors.

#####Step 5: Pick k eigenvalues and form a matrix of eigenvectors.

#####Step 6: Transform the original matrix.
